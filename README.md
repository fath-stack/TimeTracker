# ⏱️ DevTime Tracker

A minimal, developer-focused productivity timer that only counts _real_ focused work.

## 🚀 Project Goal

Developers often “work” for hours, but only a fraction of that time is actual deep work and usually hurt themselves by working too much.  
**DevTime Tracker** solves this by tracking _only the minutes you stay on that work and fully focused_.  
This tiny app solves one very real problem:

“How much time did I actually spend working today?”

This project was intentionally built as a **small, high-impact tool** to practice:

- shipping fast
- managing a micro project end-to-end
- improving React/Next.js skills
- improving focus & self-discipline

## 🎯 Features (v0.3)

✔️ Start a focus session with one click  
✔️ Timer keeps running even if you:  
• switch tabs or minimize browser (no drift due to interval pauses)  
• open VSCode or any other apps (for this version)  
• refresh the page  
• close and reopen the browser  
✔️ Clean minimal UI with Next.js + React + Tailwind  
✔️ Clean time formatting (HH:MM:SS) with hours, minutes, and seconds displayed  
✔️ Reset timer via double-click or by holding  
✔️ Stores start or end timestamp (exact finish time) in localStorage for precise countdown  
✔️ Automatically calculates remaining time on app load based on system clock  
✔️ Input disabled during running session to prevent accidental changes  
✔️ Handles timer completion gracefully — clears stored data and resets UI  
✔️ Lightweight micro-project, fully deployable and optimized for performance

## 🧠 Key Problems Encountered (and Solutions)

## 1. Timer resets after page refresh

We encountered this error:

**Cause:**
`Reloading` the page erased all progress.

**Solution:**
Save only the start timestamp:

```ts
localStorage.setItem("focusStart", Date.now());
```

On load, reconstruct elapsed time:

```ts
(Date.now() - storedStart) / 1000;
```

### 2. ❌ `setInterval` typing error with TypeScript

We encountered this error:

**Cause:**  
`Node.js` and browsers return different interval types.  
`setInterval` in Node returns a `Timeout` object, not a number.

**Solution:**  
Use a union type:

```ts
let interval : <number | null> = null;
```

Now the type is number or null.

### 3. ❌ clearInterval() complaining about type mismatch

We encountered this one:

**Cause:**
You cannot pass `null` into `clearInterval()`.

**solution:**
By using an simple If:

```ts
if (interval !== null) {
  clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
}
```
